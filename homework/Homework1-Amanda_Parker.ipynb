    "Read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) for a useful look at the different types of data scientists. Write down 5 key points you took away from the article\n",

    "* Business, Creative/Hackers, Developers & Researchers\n",
    "* T-shaped data scientists; the horizontal line in T the bredth of skills with one area of deep expertise (vertical line). Ref to the DS Venn diagram by Conway. The Business, REsearcher and Developer clusters seem to fit T pattern, the Creatives less so, perhaps because their skill is in being generalists\n",

    "* George is an Australian with a PhD in applied mathematics from USyd, entrepaneur associated with numerous tech companies, tech business history starting from before 90's .com crash. Bayesian image processing techniques for astronomical images\n",

    "* Difference between a data gopher and a data scientist is in the business understanding\n",

    "| Mainstream programming language | 10% | 5/10 |\n",
    "| Mainstream scripting language | 5% | 7/10 |\n",
    "* The most useful insight for me was about how academics communicate; George writes about how academics are deeply involved in process and communicate it linearely whereas business stakeholders want the main insights straight away - that resonated with me greatly as a corporate designer with an academic background: I go into too much detail when justifying design decsisions. \n",
    "* The comments about efficiency and results over 'knowledge for knowledge sake' again resonate, it's very easy to get wrapped up in a design or analytics problem because it is inherently interesting rather than interesting *and* useful. He also expands on this by saying 'don't fall in love with your ideas. Market feedback is the only thing that matters\" (sic) - in Data Science, lol \n",
    "* Building relationships with non-technical stakeholders important, speak to all sorts of people, good advice for life too.\n",
    "* Importance of business process, IMO Data Science and Buisness Analysts seem very close, with the former unleasing awesome data skills into their craft. Business understanding also very important for good designers. \n",
    "* \"A successful data scientist changes the world around them\" noice, likewise a sucessfull designer - however, the ethics and character of the Data Scientist is what makes this statement either good or bad.\n",
    "* George says his CS degree didn't impart team work skills, I wonder if this is different now-a-days, group work was a constant in my undergrad uni experience, and seemed even more present when I got to teach some classes, however that was not in CS field. \n",
    "* Future: an explosion of consumer and enterprise apps built on data science - completely agree - there are so many interesting things sitting in the masses of data we are collecting but not looking at.\n",
